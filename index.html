    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
        There are two main goals of this project:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine what a program is doing in order to provide search and tools for developers looking at code that is not their own</li>
        <li>Indicate to the developer various code smells that might be present</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        What a program is doing may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What functions are draw stuff and what are their names?</li>
        <li>Are there variables that change over time?  Do they affect what is being drawn?  How? move, grow, shrink, change color, etc.</li>
        <li>Are there variables that change in response to user action?  Do these variables affect what is drawn?</li>
        <li>What informal data structures are there?  Are there other programs with the same structures?</li>
        <li>Is there shared/duplicate code between programs?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Demo</h2>

        Coming soon!
